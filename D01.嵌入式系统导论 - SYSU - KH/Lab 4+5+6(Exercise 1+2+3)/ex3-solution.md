## Ex 3.1

### 1. Explain the difference between private, shared and exclusive resources and give an example of problems encountered in exclusive resources.


### 2.Propose three ways such that the problem occurring in Resource Sharing Problem of mutual exclusion (mutual exclusion) can be solved.


### 3. Explain the application of a possible solution of the previous part.


# Ex 3.2

### 1. In the lecture you learned about the Priority Inheritance Protocol (PIP). Does the PIP solve the problem of deadlocks? Give a brief explanation for your response.


### 2. Given are the four tasks J1, J2, J3 and J4. The table below contains information on their arrival times, deadlines, their execution time and priorities. The tasks with fixed priorities should be handled by a fixed priority scheduling processor as far as possible within their deadlines.


### 3.create a scheduling with the Priority Inheritance Protocol and fill out the chart prepared below. Highlight the critical Portions of the tasks with the letters A and B as specified in the last line of the table . Please also characterized p4 which is the active priority of Task J4 in the given diagram. Note: Pay close attention to the priorities of the individual tasks!


### 4. Are all deadlines satisfied through the application of the PIP? If not, how big is the maximum delay (maximum lateness) in units of time?


### 5.Is there a schedule for the tasks specified J1 to J4 that meets all deadlines? What changes should be made to the priority? If there is a correct schedule, please show it in the graph provided below. Otherwise, explain why there can be no correct schedule.
