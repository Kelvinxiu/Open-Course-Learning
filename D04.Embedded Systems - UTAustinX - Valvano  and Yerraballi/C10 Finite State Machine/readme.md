# C10 Finite State Machine

## 10.0 Intro

Learning Objectives:

* Learn how to activate the PLL(phase-lock-loop) so the microcontroller has an accurate time base

* Use SysTick to produce accurate time delays

* Learn how to organize data on the computer using structures

* Develop a design strategy for building Finite State Machines

* Explain how stepper motors work using two motors to make an autonomous robot
