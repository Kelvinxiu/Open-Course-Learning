## 3.0 Introduction

Learning Objectives:

* Understand current, voltage, power, energy.
* Review Ohm’s Law.
* Apply some simple rules for solving circuits with batteries and resistors.

### Ohm’s Law:

**Ohm’s Law: Voltage = Current * Resistance**

### Circuit Basics

**Charge** is measured in **coulumbs** (C). Charge measured at a point or on an object and does not have a direction. For example, one electron has about -1.602×10−19 coulombs.

**Current** is measured in **amps** (A). Amps is the same as coulombs/sec. Current represents a flow of charge and hence has a direction. For example, we will drive about 3mA through an LED to turn it on.

**Energy** is measured in **Joules** (J). Other equivalent units of energy are newton-meter, watt-sec, V-A-sec, or kg-m2/s2. Energy is defined inside an object and does not have a direction. For example, an alkaine battery typically contains about 1.6 kJ, which means it can supply 50 mA at 9V for about 10 hours. 16200J = 0.05A * 9V * 10hr * (60min/hr) * (60sec/min). The actual numbers will vary depending on temperature, current, and the age of the battery.

**Power** is the rate of doing work. It is equivalent to an amount of energy consumed per unit time. Power is defined at an object and does not have a direction. The units of power are the **joules per second** (J/s), or watt, V-A, or kg-m2/s3. For example, when we activate an LED at with a voltage of 2V and a current of 3mA, we are dissapating 6mW of power into the LED. The efficiency of the LED determines how much of the electrical power (in watts) is converted to optical brightness (in lumens).

**Voltage** is measured in volts (V). Other equivalent units of voltage are W/A, J/C, or kg-m2/A-s3. Voltage is defined as the potential difference between** **two points that will impart one joule of energy per coulomb of charge that passes through it.


**Power = Voltage * Current**
**Energy = Power * Time**

### Kirchhoff's Laws

Kirchhoff's Voltage Law (KVL)：The sum of the voltages around the loop is zero.

Kirchhoff's Current Law (KCL)：The sum of the currents into a node equal the sum of the currents leaving a node.
